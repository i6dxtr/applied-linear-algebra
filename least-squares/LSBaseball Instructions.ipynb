    "In lecture we considered a special case of this (where the mean of b is 0) here is the full story.  Suppose you are solving a least squares problem $\\min_x \\| Ax-b  \\|$ and $x_0$ is the unique solution. The error term $\\| Ax_0 - b  \\|$ describes how far off you are. In isolation this error term is basically meaningless, but when correctly normalized it contains valuable information.  Define the sum-squared error (SSE) as\n",

    "Although not totally obvious we always have $0\\leq R^2\\leq 1$ (it's an exercise you could do).  Roughly speaking, but not always correct, the higher the $R^2$ the better the job our linear model does to predict the outcome.  A rough interpretation of $R^2$ as a percentage: Say $R^2=.73$, then the model accounts for $73$% of the variance in the data. \n",
